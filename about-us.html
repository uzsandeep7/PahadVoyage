        <h2>Q.What is the difficulty level of the treks? </h2>
        <p>We offer treks for all skill levels: Easy, Moderate, and Difficult. Each trek page includes a difficulty rating and physical requirements. </p>

         <h2>How are porters used on the trek?</h2>
        <p>Porters carry your main backpack (usually up to 10â€“12 kg per person), so you only need to carry a daypack with essentials like water, snacks, and a camera. </p>
